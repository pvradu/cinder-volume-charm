  hostname:
    type: string
    description: |
      Hostname reported by all cinder agents. It defaults to the computer hostname.
      If this is set, only the cinder volume agent from the leader unit will be
      running. This option should be set when shared storage is used in order
      to avoid cinder reporting wrong storage available.
  openstack-version:
    type: string
    default: queens
    description: |
      Version of Openstack Cinder to install. This is used to generate
      conf file and to choose the default installer url in case it is not
      specified in the config option. Choices are:
       * newton

    type: string
    description: |
      This will compare the allocated to available space on the volume
      destination. If the ratio exceeds this number, the destination will
      no longer be valid. Used by the smbfs driver. Defaults to '1.0'.
  default-volume-format:

  installer-url:
    type: string
    description: |
      Overwrite default installer location. Take care to set the correct openstack-version
      as that will be used by the charm to pick the correct config templates.
      If you use this option, you may enable file integrity checking by specifying
      an md5sum at the end of the URL as follows:
        https://example.com/installer.msi#md5=<hash>

  change-hostname:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The hostname set inside the newly spawned machine is usually the same as
      the name of the instance being spawned. In cases where the instance name
      is larger then 15 characters (maximum size for windows NetBios names), the
      instance name gets truncated to the first 15 characters. This creates a problem,
      as hostnames in active directory, for example, are very important. Having more
      then one machine with the same hostname try to join the same domain, will
      create trust issues.
      This option allows changing the hostname of the current running system to a
      combination of the first 14 (or less, depending on how many digits the unit number has)
      characters of the charm name and the unit number. While this is not infallible,
      It does have less of a chance of creating hostname conflicts.
